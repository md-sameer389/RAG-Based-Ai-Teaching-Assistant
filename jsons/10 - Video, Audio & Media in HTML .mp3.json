time"}], "text": " In today's video, we will learn how audio, video and media elements are used in HTML. In our very first video, we saw that we can embed videos in HTML. Today I will tell you how the video is auto-played, how to keep a muted video, and how you can enable and disable the video controls. Along with that, we will also see very closely about audio, how media can be shown in an overall page. So do like this video and stay in this video because the examples I have used for video tags are very amazing. Let's go to the video screen. Let's roll the intro. Intro Friends, this time I have made a folder named video10. I will not waste your time by opening the open with code by right-clicking and shifting. In fact, I will make it in index.html. And the topic of today's video is video. How to play a video, how to put a video in an HTML file, how to put audio, how to put media. So adding a video is very straightforward. I will copy it here, which is our video tag. It has an src attribute and it has some other attributes about which I will discuss with you. But first of all, I want to tell you here that video src is equal to you will write here, so if you have video.mp4, it will play. I have video.mp4. So let's see here, I have put it here with ctrl. And I will click here and preview it. And you can see here that this video has come. Now it is a very big video. So what can I do? I can give its width. So I can say here width is equal to 555 pixels. And as soon as I do 555 pixels, in fact, I don't need to write px. I will only do 555. Like we don't need to write px in the image. We don't need to write px here either. So as soon as I did width is equal to 555, in fact, I do one thing. I do height is equal to 555 so that it becomes smaller. In fact, I make it smaller. I make it 255. And you see it came here. Okay? Now I play it because I have clicked ctrl. I can play it. Look here, the road is better than America right now. What's your name? Gopindra Jogi. Where have you been in the US? I have been to many places in the US. Tell me your name. Gopindra Jogi. Hahaha. So, this is how you can play the video. Now here are some attributes of video tag. See, using video tag is very simple. You should have a video. You have given the path of the video. After that, you have given the controls. So these controls will come to you. You can download it. You can do full screen. You can mute. You can do picture in picture. All this is automatically provided by your browser. But let me tell you about some attributes. The first attribute is SRC. So you know that put the video here. The name of the video file is SRC. This video file can also come from the external URL. You understand? That is, if I have uploaded a video on Amazon S3 or somewhere else, then I can also put the URL there. I mean, it is not necessary that the file is in your computer. It can also be on your server. It can also come from third party. Now what does the controls do? Adds video controls like play, pause and volume. Which we saw here in the Bhopendra Jogi video. That you are getting the controls here. Now what is this thing? The browser automatically checks what control ads will be in your video. What will not be. Then see what will autoplay do? It will automatically play as soon as the page loads. Okay? So if I put autoplay here, let's say I put autoplay here. Okay? So see. So you can see here that it has been autoplayed. Okay? So I will remove autoplay from here. And the next attribute we have is loop. That is, once our video is played, it will keep looping. Like I show you. So it started again. Once I finished it, it started again. Okay? So this loop works like this. The next attribute is muted. Muted mutes the video. So if I write here muted. Sometimes we want the video to be muted. In fact, when I add videos here. On codewithhari.com. And I demonstrate something. Like downloading VS Code or something. So I use the muted attribute. Because I don't want when I record a video, if there is any background noise, you can hear it. For example, I want to show you that this is the element. So I will scroll and make a video. I will highlight it like this. So I don't need audio in it. So I mute it. So you can use the muted attribute on your website. Then poster. Poster is very important. So I have an image here. Download.jpg. Okay? If I write here poster is equal to. And I write download.jpg. So you guys see it will look like this. Okay? This is how the poster looks. Then I will play. So the video will play. So in a way thumbnail. Okay? You saw the thumbnail of the YouTube video. Exactly the same. This is the poster attribute. So you can use all these attributes. Width and height. You know that. Specify the dimension of the video. Like I added both width and height here. You saw. So I hope you guys understood this thing. Now the thing I want to tell you after this is audio. So this is for all the attributes of your video. It is very straightforward. I want you to make a website. Great. Which I am going to give you at the end of this video. In quick quiz. So listen to the quick quiz. In fact, I will put the heading here. Quick quiz from now on. Okay? So that I don't forget. I will give you this now. And this is going to be a very interesting quiz. And everyone must solve it. But before that. As soon as you write audio. Here comes SRC. And I have to put it in sachin.mp3. So as soon as I put it in sachin.mp3. Now see here. I will reload it. And there is no audio here. Which is strange. Let's see what the problem is here. I put SRC is equal to. I have to write controls here too. So if I don't write controls. Then I won't see the audio. See now the audio has come. I can see the controls here. I can also set its volume. I play this audio. What is Sachin in Sachin? Is it a stupid Sachin? Okay. So this is our audio. If I mute it and run it. Then it won't work. And I can also increase it further. Is it a stupid Sachin? Okay. You guys have seen. So this is audio named sachin.mp3. Now what we will do. That. We will see some attributes of this audio. SRC you know. That source. Video file. Okay. Then after this you know the controls. Play, pause or volume. Which we just saw. What will autoplay do? It will play it automatically. If I have here. Autoplay. What is Sachin in Sachin? Automatically played. Is it a stupid Sachin? So what does it do by autoplaying? Automatically played. Our audio. After this. The next attribute is. That is loop. What will loop do? It will repeat. If I want to loop it. Then I have autoplayed. Now I will loop. What is Sachin in Sachin? Is it a stupid Sachin? Once. What is Sachin in Sachin? Second time. Is it a stupid Sachin? So you saw it was repeated. Means once it was played. Then after that it was played again. Because I had looped the audio. Okay. So you guys have seen this thing. Sachin.mp3. I looped it. Means once it was played. Then it was played. Then it was played. What is Sachin? Sachin. Okay. She was saying again and again. Because this MP3. It will be played again and again. So there are many such cases. When you want. That this MP3 is repeat. Okay. So if you want. That your MP3 is repeat. Then you can use it. Now after this. What will mutate do? Will mute the audio. And definitely you don't want. That by default. Your audio is mute. In most of the cases. But. Sometimes we will want. That the audio is muted. And we can say here. To the user. That the audio is muted. And we can say here. That the audio is muted. And we can say here. To the user. That whoever wants to listen. Unmute it. Sachin what is it? When do we do this? When there are multiple audios. You want to show 5-6 audios together. You can mute them. The user can play. And see it unmuted. Okay. So. You have control in your hand. If you want. You can use this thing. Okay. In total this is the thing. So I hope. You have understood this thing. You must have enjoyed. Now preload. The most confusing attribute. And that's why. I have explained it on codewithaddy.com. That the preload attribute. It can have these values. So. The preload attribute. It can have these values. The first value can be none. This is the default value. It indicates. That the browser should not preload. The audio at all. Okay. Preload means. If you want. The browser to fetch the data. Then you will use the preload attribute. Otherwise you will not use the preload attribute. Okay. Preload is equal to none. It is the default value. Preload is equal to metadata. It means. That the browser. Only the metadata. That is. The information about that audio file. It will preload it. It will load it from the beginning. And by auto. You can. Preload. So. And by auto. What will happen. The browser will preload. The entire audio. Okay. So preload is equal to auto. If I do this. It will download. And automatically load. So that whenever the user plays it. Then the audio will be saved. Okay. So. This is the work of the preload attribute. And in interviews. It is asked a lot. This preload attribute. So you should know. What is the preload attribute. Before moving forward. I want. That you share this playlist. With your friends. Because I am seeing. That the interest is declining a lot. Like this. We are moving forward in the videos. I have shared with you. That you like this video. And along with that. As you are. Focusing on this repository. You have to star it. Okay. Your star. Your likes. All this will help me a lot. To bring such free courses. So this was. About audio and video tags. Okay. I have told you all the attributes. Here. And you definitely. Use it. All the images. I will give you. So that you can try it out. This thing. Now a lot of people were asking. That can we use replit. See. In this course. I have not used replit. But. I have used. I have used. I have not used replit. But replit.com is an amazing website. If you want. You use it in your phone. If you want to run html. There is a replit app. For ios. For android. So you can try it out. A lot of people are asking. How to do recording in the phone. Replit. But what I want now. VS code. Which most of the people. Want to use. Prefer. So I thought. Why not make videos in VS code. But I personally. Use replit a lot. Infact videos also come in replit. Next topic is svg. Media services. So I have. Made a video. About. About. About. My svg image. So I will. Take a look. You can see. Here. Now what is here. You can save svg file. Separately. You can save svg file separately. For example. If I write here. Img.svg. And save svg content in it. So if I. Here. Write it here. And write it here. Img.svg. So you guys see here. I am not seeing this. If I write alt. And write. My svg image. So you see. Here. My svg image. Has come like this. But svg file. Has come like this. but i didn't get to see svg why did this happen? because svg svg file in browser and when you want to see svg file in browser you will put a declaration i will show you, so i wrote here svg file not showing so here is an answer of stack overflow which will tell you, so you have to write this, i will show you xml something like this you have to add this name space declaration so svg you have to add this and now you can see svg here, so this is very important and many people in future when you will make websites they will get stuck in this problem i get stuck in this problem, so i am telling you i have already told you the problem you didn't get the problem, i told you the problem and solution next topic is iframes iframes is a very simple thing you can embed another website in your website like if i want to embed this web page so i can use iframe like this, so see i wrote iframe this and i will copy this url and i will paste here and you can see that this website is embedded in this iframe you definitely want to embed in big iframe but if you want to embed it, so you can embed it like this i will increase the height so width is equal to width is written, width is equal to let's say 122, height is equal to 444, ok so see this is how it came now definitely this width was coming, so it came in this line but if i increase the width let's say i increase the width to 322 ok, so see this my website is completely embedded you can see, so you can embed a website another use case of iframe is youtube video, if you want you can share youtube video and click on embed, so it will give you iframe code and you can start it from here if you want to start at a particular time you can do that here, at the point you start and share it that time comes here, i will show you let's say i want to start from here ok, let's say video starts from here so what i will do, i will click on share after clicking on share, i will click on embed i will click on start at 1219 and i will copy it, see here and i will put it in my code so i will comment this iframe and i will put it in the iframe below ok, i will do word wrap so that you can see the code properly so now what i will do after pasting this i will show you the document see this video is embedded here ok, so i hope you understood this thing and media in html is only this pretty much ok, miscellaneous in every topic you will see many things but pretty much that's all about media, in html audio, video media is only this much, this is what you will use 95% of the times now i will give you a quick quiz and your quick quiz is create a website which shows videos of different category, ok and audios of different categories you can use youtube videos in an iframe using youtube's embedding feature so what you have to do you have to create a website in which you will get a lot of content now you can use video audio tags and youtube's share feature the way i have embedded youtube video, you can do the same and make a very good website and show me you can give me a github comment and you can also tell me the code and explain but do attempt this quiz and do write sigma batch op in the comment section access this playlist and do like this video and do write sigma batch op thank you so much guys for watching this video and i will see you next time"}
