    "text": " From today's video, we will start the Sigma Web Development course. Like this video with high energy, because in this video, I am going to make you a profitable web developer from zero. This course will be very modern because web development has changed over time. A lot of new things have come, a lot of things have come in JavaScript that make work very easy. A lot of such technologies have come that will make your work very easy. This course will be for those people who know nothing. You know zero if this course is for you about web development. We will start from zero, but in the future we will raise the bar like anything. What will we learn in this course, I will tell you in a while. Web development is a very profitable thing. I have personally earned a lot of money through web development. And my belief is that you can also be very successful by learning web development. During the course, you will be given notes, cheat sheets, references, all these things. This course is going to be a little different because I will tell you all the technologies that you should learn according to your experience in this course. And I will make this course a complete course with all the web development technologies. The course content will be complete web development, front-end, back-end, database. I will teach you as much as you should learn. I will tell you what exactly the course content will be in a while. But you guys have faith that I will make you a full-stack developer. A lot of projects will be done for you in the course. And at the end of the course, we will make some good projects. So that your grip on web development can become very strong. According to me, project-based learning is the best way to learn. That's why I will make a lot of projects for you. And if you agree, then write in the comment section below. I agree. Because when you comment, I get a smile on my face. So do comment. I want to assure you that after finishing this course, you will be able to make any kind of website from start to end. And during this course, I will make a lot of websites for you so that your confidence will go up a lot. So let's start with the first video of our Sigma Web Development course. Let's roll the intro. Alright guys, so I have come to my computer screen. And now follow me as I am doing. I have downloaded the Google Chrome browser. You also download the Google Chrome browser. I am not saying that it will not work. But you guys have to do exactly the same as a beginner. What I am doing here. So here we will follow exactly as I am doing. And as the videos come, you will be able to follow exactly. I will go to Google quickly. And I will write here. Download VS Code Now what is this VS Code? VS Code is a source code editor. If I am in Windows, then I will click on Windows. If you are in Mac, Linux or any other operating system. Then you can download it for that strange operating system. And the process will be exactly the same. You can see that VS Code has come in my Downloads folder. And here you can see, this setup is downloaded. I will refresh here. And here you can see, I can double click on VS Code setup. So simply install VS Code. As easy as installing a game. You read the agreement quickly. This license applies to... da...da...da...da...da... Damages. And after this I will accept the agreement. You also read it like me. And I am the fastest reader in the world. da...da...da...da...da... Next, next. Here it is important to check both icons. Checking both icons is very important. Check it, okay? If you want a desktop shortcut. That is, if you want to get a shortcut in the desktop. Click on Create a Desktop icon. And after this, we will do next. Then we will install. If your PC is fast like me, then it will be this fast. But if your PC is slow. Then there is no problem. It will be a little slow install. Nothing more than this will happen. Now here I will recommend you. That you subscribe to the channel now. Because these videos. I want you to follow exactly. As soon as I put the video, you get a notification. So if you want to follow this course completely. Ideally you should subscribe. With that said, our VS Code has been downloaded. I have opened my VS Code. Don't be afraid to see this. Beginners, don't be afraid to see this. And I am saying this again. If you already know things. We are taking a beginner friendly start here. In the initial videos. But we will raise the bar like anything. In the upcoming videos. So stay tuned. Hi. Okay, I will request you guys. Tell me in the comment section. What is your level? Are you a beginner, advanced or intermediate user? Tell me in the comment section. How much do you know about web development? Beginner, advanced, intermediate. Please, you guys do comment. Now what is VS Code here? Why did we download it? Let's understand this. So if you are a beginner. You don't know what VS Code is. Let me tell you that VS Code is a code editor. Which helps you to edit code. Now you will say. Harry, I can edit code in notepad. So yes, do it in notepad. It will also be done in it. Yes, I am not saying sarcastically. It will be done in it. Here we set it up. And show what is in it. Which makes it a little different from notepad. Look here, we set it up quickly. I will not browse here with color themes. In fact, I do it. I keep dark modern here. My theme. And I did all this. Next section. After this, next section. If you want, you can also close this welcome. But again, here are some tips. I am telling you. That's it. Your VS Code is here. It has started. This is the screen of VS Code. You can see. You can make a new file here. You can make a new folder. But I will recommend you. That you close it. Yes, you close it. Why did you close it? I am going to make a new folder here. And I am going to keep it in its name. You guessed it right. Sigma Web Development Course. And we will do everything in this course. We will do everything. We will do everything. Means understand. We will do related to the course. We will not do much. Now here you will press shift and right click. If you are in Windows. So you can see here. That an option called Open with Code is coming. This option called Open with Code. Helps you to open this particular folder in VS Code. Now you will select it here. Now what will you do here? You will say, Yes, I trust this file. Click on it here. Yes, I trust the authors. And this folder has now opened. Means if I click on plus here. To make a new file. Suppose I have written here. Index.html Write now. Even if you don't know what I am writing. Write. Hit enter. And after this. What will I do? That I will write here. Hey, I am your first HTML file. Suppose I wrote this. Here you can see this dot. This dot is of white color. This dot means. That you have not saved this file. Please save it. Hit ctrl s. It will be saved. I will recommend you. Go to the file. Enable the auto save option here. So as you type. Similarly, you will not see this dot. Your file will be saved instantly. As you type. And I also recommend this thing. We will not use ctrl s. Otherwise, if you want to save with ctrl s. Then you can disable this option. One more thing I would like to do with you. You click on gear here. Then click on settings. And search here. Mouse. Mouse. Mouse. Now see here. Editor. Mouse wheel zoom. Check this. What will happen by checking this? I will tell you. Check everything and close it in settings. Now you don't have to be afraid at all. What is VS Code? Why is VS Code? How is VS Code? What is this? Why is this? What is this news? Yes, but you don't have to see all this now. Now you will simply press ctrl. If you scroll like this. So what happens? That your font size. It changes. Now I will show you a magic. What is magic? It is a very simple logic. That here in downloads. What happened in the folder named sigma web development course? That this file was made. Index.html. Which is very natural. Because I have opened this folder in VS Code. Because I have opened this folder in VS Code. This file is also made here. I will make another file here. Suppose I make a file named this.txt. I will write this is this. So what will happen? This file will be made here too. You can see. So this folder and this VS Code. Both are running in sync. Okay. Now if I open this file from here with notepad. And I will show you. My file will open in notepad. So I can do that too. That is also my choice. But I will not use notepad. Because there are some things in VS Code. Which notepad does not give me. And I want that I get those features. I do not want to overwhelm you. But I show you. What is there in VS Code? Which you do not get in notepad. If I write here. Suppose html. If I hit enter. Then it automatically gave me the opening and closing tag. If I hit the exclamation mark here. Then it gives me a boilerplate template of html. If I click on it. Then see the basic code of html. It came here. We will discuss about it later. Do not get overwhelmed by this. But I want to tell you. How it is beneficial in VS Code. Why we did not use notepad. Why we used VS Code. And this feel comes. We are getting such a good feel. We are getting the feel of a developer. We are getting the feel of a hacker. That feel is also important. That is why the confidence will come. To do coding. Now for Mac and Linux users. I want to comment here. Things are going to be exactly similar. For you too. I am using Windows. Because I have a Windows laptop. I can't use three laptops. I can't use Linux, Mac and Windows. So things will be exactly same for you. In fact, I should say. Things will be similar. Not exactly same. Things will be very similar. Okay. So you can follow along very easily. So do not worry at all. I will tell you about some extensions. In a while. And you will enjoy. Using those extensions. And you will also say. It is fun. What did you recommend? But I will tell you in a while. And this is criminally underrated. I am telling you. You will enjoy. Before that, I would like to tell you. You will right click. Click on the command palette. So here are a lot of options for VS Code. You do not need to know all these options. As we move forward in the course. Whatever feature. As it comes into use. I will keep telling you. And you guys use it. But what I will do here now. I will toggle a screencast mode. You don't have to do this. But I will do it. You will know what will happen. I clicked. So now see I will type anything. If I press caps lock. Caps lock will come here. So you will know. Which button I pressed when. Now this thing is not at all relevant for you guys. But I just want to tell you. What is screencast mode? What is screencast mode? We can change its settings from here. Now here you see. Screencast mode has a vertical offset. What does vertical offset mean? If I make vertical offset 0. So it came up. If I make vertical offset 70. So it came down. I will make it 60. I will make it 60. If I give space here. So it came here. If I make it 80. So it came here. That means. From bottom how much will it look up. So I made it 0. In fact I made it 1. Now I will type anything here. For example, I made it this. You will see it at the bottom. Which is ideal. So what I will do is. I will close this file of this.txt. I will close the settings tab. These are tabs basically. Like tabs in chrome. Your tabs are exactly the same. So I hope you know what it is. What we have written about it. You will forget. I will tell you step by step. What exactly is what? You can also close the welcome page. Of VS Code. By any chance. If you want to zoom in on VS Code. Which I will do. Because I am recording a video. Now add control plus. Add the plus of numpad. Look below. I have shown you. I am zooming in. I am zooming in because. I am recording videos. So ideally I would like. That you can see the screen from close. But when I am doing my coding. Then I don't zoom in so much. Because you have to keep this thing in mind. So these are related to VS Code. Now I want to tell you. How do websites work? A website basically. Works through three types of people. Imagine three people. One is client. One is server. Who is client? Who is the other? Server. Who is the third? Browser. Who is also called Babu brother. Browser. So browser. Client. Server. What is this client? What is this server? What is this browser? I am the client. You. All of us. Who use a browser. Who is the browser? This is Chrome. Hello Chrome. I am the client. I will tell the client. When I write codewithharry.com. Suppose I write codewithharry.com. So what I basically say. I say. From this browser. Please give me codewithharry.com website. Or if I write here. Youtube.com. I say. Give me youtube.com website. I say. Browser. Give me youtube.com. I want to see youtube. What does the browser say? You want youtube? Take this. Okay. So here. I will enter youtube.com. So from the server. He brought youtube.com. Are you understanding? From the server. He brought youtube.com. He showed me this screen. This work happened so soon. Because my internet.com. Internet.com. Internet speed is very fast. It is so less. Nowadays people are even faster. But still. According to my locality. It is very fast. Okay. So with this fast internet speed. Things are getting very fast. Okay. So the client sends a request to the server. Through the browser. Browser is the client. That is, my assistant. Whatever I will say from the browser. He will do that. Will help me. From the server. To bring this web page. Who is managing the server? Server is being managed. Youtube.com. Youtube.com. Server is being managed. And inside that server. Some code is written. Which sends me. This kind of code. That is, when I write youtube.com. This code came. Now how to convert this code. This work is of the browser. That is, how do I show. This work is of the browser. So the client says to the browser. Something like this. Hey kid. Give me youtube.com. Browser says. Kid. You want youtube.com. Wait. I will ask for youtube.com. Youtube.com. Then the browser goes to the server. That is, a request is made to the server. Says to the server. Give me youtube.com. Server will give it here. Or will say. Is not there. Or will say. Error. Or will say. Server error. Did not get. Whatever response will be. Ideally. Which should be 200. A response code is 200. With this response. Which is our browser. Comes back to the client. And shows this kind of page. I hope this is clear to you. Client. Browser. Server. Okay. So the client is with the browser. Browser is with the server. Back to the browser. So this is how this thing works. This thing is a little more important. I tell you once again. When you write google.com. Any website. Google.com. So the client says to the browser. Give me google.com. Browser says. Hey teacher. You want google.com. Wait. I will also bring it from the server. So the browser goes to the server. And brings google.com. So the client says. Give me google.com. So the browser brings google.com. And gives you. You have google.com. Now with google.com. The server. All those images. All videos. Whatever things are there. It sends all. Like these icons. It sends all. The URL of these icons. Is also written in this code. And that too. The work of the browser. To display us properly. So the server. It sends a whole bundle to the browser. Sends this kind of bundle. And by passing this bundle. Showing like this. The work of the browser. Now whatever further interaction. The user. With this page. Browser. Browser. Browser. Browser. Now with this page. Browser. Will ask for additional requests. If I do it right. And inspect. And after that. I go to the network. And here I write. Assume. Harry bhai. Assume I wrote. Harry bhai. So see. So many requests. It sent. For images. And many more requests. It sent. So as you. Interact. Similarly. More requests. Additionally. Will have to send. To the browser. So in total. You consider it. Like a restaurant. You gave the order. You sent your order. To the kitchen. Kitchen. You consider it. And after that. Finally. When the kitchen. Gave the order. So what did. This waiter. Who is working. As a browser. That waiter. Gave you. Order again. It may be that. That order. Can't be made in the kitchen. For some reason. It is very rare. That you do something. And you did not get it. But it happens. Sometimes. Similarly. Sometimes it happens here. That error is seen. 404 error. Or 500 error. You consider it. Like a restaurant. So this is. The cycle. Which is. Going on. Client. Request. Browser. Again. But it is. The server. That will. Make. The request. Again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And again. As we. Have. Lot of data. So what will you do? You will. Store every web page separately. Or you. Will generate it. Dynamically. You will. Generate it. Dynamically. I. Take the example. If. I search Harry by. So you can see here that. This is. Google's header. Links. This format. Doesn't change. If I write here. Suppose. Shubham. OK. Suppose I wrote. Shubham. So I. Google is showing me similar content Google's server backend processes the data so that it can send this kind of HTML for the query so when i write Shubham, it sends this so the process of generating this is happening through the same system this backend can be jango, flask, nodejs this backend can be PHP, this backend can be Ruby on Rails and the database inside the backend is used, the backend code is not visible to the client this is the frontend code which is sent by the server and how the server made this code, we don't know because this code is running on the server if you are confused, don't worry, you will understand all this we will see the backend later, now we will understand how the frontend works, the frontend is made of 3 languages, HTML, CSS and JavaScript these are the 3 languages which are needed if you are making a website every website needs HTML, CSS, JavaScript if you use only HTML then it becomes a basic skeleton of the website after that when you use CSS, you can style it like this button is like this, it is only visible because of CSS along with that, this button is red this button is curved all this is happening because of CSS the edges are happening because of CSS CSS is used to style the page what will be the color of the button, what will happen by hovering all these things are done through CSS CSS is the beauty of HTML HTML is the existence of any page this is a standard which is agreed upon HTML is made in HTML so that the browser can understand how to parse it, the job of the browser is to parse HTML and HTML is a skeleton this is a standard, whoever will make a website in this world will make it in HTML, will use skeleton HTML this is a standard, this standard is made so that everyone can make the same type of pages and if someone is making a browser, then the same language has to be parsed if as a beginner you have learned 80% HTML then you are good to go now some things happen directly through HTML like if I show you a very quick HTML code so I am writing HTML code like this I have used the exclamation mark and the emmet abbreviation, you don't have to worry how I have written this code, I will write and I can open this HTML file directly and as soon as I open this HTML file you can see it will open like this I can open this directly and it has opened, now see HTML is written here but it is not styled at all this HTML file is very basic now you can directly run videos through HTML I have an HTML file which I will show you I will show you this HTML file so that we can show videos in this so there is a video tag in HTML, if you enter video then the video will be played like if I enter video 1.mp4 now you can see the video is automatically shown this is the benefit of using VS code so you can see here, I will reload it so the video is automatically shown, I can play it to play it I have to write controls and I will refresh it now so I can play it now if I enter video 2.mp4 I have entered video 1, I have 2 more videos I have some more videos here, if I enter it and then I will refer it if I enter video 2.mp4 instead of it, then video 2 will be shown I will reload it and show you this is Ben Stokes look alike now you can see this is Ben Stokes look alike now if I enter video 3 then my third video will be shown so I will reload it and you can see this is our third video I have entered video 3.mp4 so I will close it and similarly we can enter video 4 and video 4 is a DJ video in which DJ is playing so you can see so you can make such things using only HTML, you don't need to do anything else you can play videos with HTML you can display images, all this can be done with HTML now if you want to style it, like I want a border or this should be in red color background for that I will use CSS CSS adds beauty to any website then comes JavaScript which adds interaction to a website, for example what will happen when I click on search what will happen when I type code with HRE and here auto complete is shown why it is shown, because a request is shown and for this query, auto complete results so all these things are done with JavaScript this is called client side scripting if we want to do scripting or coding in client only on client side, we can do it with JavaScript this is brain too, so our website is beauty with brain I am talking about website, beauty with brain CSS adds beauty and brain comes from JavaScript JavaScript helps you to make page dynamic for example, if you want to change content without loading page all this is done with JavaScript so many mosquitoes are coming here, so let me kill them they are not getting anything from here my racket is working like the video, because I eat snacks of current for you when I was in college, someone told me learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript learn 100% HTML, learn 100% CSS, learn JavaScript this is wrong, because HTML is 80% and CSS is 40-60% and JavaScript is 50-70% you can start web development, make projects and you can move forward in this course, I will tell you about chat gpt and web development what is the impact of chat gpt, so we will talk about this too you stay tuned, so never run after perfection don't run after HTML, CSS don't think that I will do HTML for 1 year, CSS for next year then JavaScript in 3rd year and then make projects in 4th year, never think like this do HTML 80% CSS 40-60% and JavaScript 50-70% and you can make a great website and as you make website your experience will teach you more HTML, CSS, JavaScript and you will not even know that you have done HTML, CSS, JavaScript while you are making money and working as a professional web developer so you are earning along with learning and with that you are improving your skills so never think that I will make website only if I know all HTML tags I will make website only if I know all CSS properties I will teach you this much that matters, we are going to learn what matters and I don't want you to learn for years I have designed this course like this so that you can learn only what matters and you can learn other things from practice and I am going to teach you many things in this course here we have 2-4 mosquitoes to learn sigma web development course which is good, our audience is increasing in this course we will learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript and I will teach you tricks in this course which you have never heard of and I have learned those tricks in my career I will tell you in a course right here I have learned many tricks in my career and I want you to learn those tricks before starting if you have any doubt in this course you can use this hashtag and ask your doubt I will try to answer all the doubts and I will try to solve your doubts so if you have any question, you can ask it and please don't ask questions in comments and please don't ask questions in comments so that I can prioritize the comments I will try to answer all the doubts as much as I can and you will learn everything in this course so please like this course that will bring a smile on my face so what is react, next.js, angular so all these front end frameworks help you to use JavaScript HTML, CSS, JavaScript are made from website and they help to make this process fast and we will learn this in this course I told you that I will make this course for you I will make you from zero to hero and you can buy your seat because you have bought the ticket of sigma web development express I want to give you a good analogy HTML is just like car skeleton and then CSS and internal engine car is JavaScript as an example of a human skeleton is HTML and then skin is CSS and brain is JavaScript and then skin is CSS and brain is JavaScript now I will take you to Forbes.com as soon as you go to Forbes.com you will see a website which uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript just like any other website now if I click on inspect now you can see they have used script in head and to add CSS they have used link so I will remove their CSS to remove CSS I will clear their style tags as soon as I remove all style tags and all link tags as soon as I delete all their style sheets look at this page this page is just raw HTML they have forgotten the size of images and only raw HTML is written here so Forbes.com is like this without CSS and similarly I can see without JavaScript now if I delete HTML tag I have deleted all the head so this is a blank page so this is the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make a web page this course was initially made to be paid but I changed my mind and I thought I will upload this on YouTube so I want you all to be serious many people have reached out to me to launch this course but I wanted to keep this course free because when I was learning web development I could understand when you don't have a course this course is free but as you earn crores you will give me tea, coffee, parties this is our agreement so when you earn crores send me a green card but you have to do this only after you start earning good so in the next video I will tell you how you can earn money and I will tell you how to do freelancing and how to earn money and how to get clients I will tell you everything I want to tell you some action items first is to access the course playlist bookmark the playlist and click on star button and click on save button many people have said that they will buy the course even if it is paid thank you so much for all the support I am getting more courage from your love but this course is going to be free I am not putting any technical issues I am putting these videos in 1080p many people say that videos are in SD, 240p, 144p you watch Bali ka Vadhu and then you say that your videos are not HD call the municipality so I hope you understood the request how these websites work we got a basic idea how client-server interaction works in the coming videos we will see how the website is made we are going to make our first website in the next video so you should be very excited and it is possible that it will be the first website of many of you so access the playlist thank you so much for watching this video and I will see you next time Thank you for
