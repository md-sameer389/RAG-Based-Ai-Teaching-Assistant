For your question about "where is HTML taught?", I'd be happy to help.

In our Sigma web development course, HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a fundamental skill that's covered in multiple videos. 

To start with HTML, let's go back to video number 03: "Basic Structure of an HTML Website". This is where we first introduce the basics of HTML and show you how it works, whether you know HTML or not.

In this video, you'll learn about headings, paragraphs, and links - essentially, the building blocks of a website. We cover this in detail from around 28 seconds into the video.

If you're interested in diving deeper into HTML, you can also check out video number 04: "Heading, Paragraphs and Links". This is where we dive deeper into the world of HTML, covering topics like semantic meaning of tags and more.

In both of these videos, I'll be guiding you through the basics of HTML so that you can understand how to build websites from scratch.
